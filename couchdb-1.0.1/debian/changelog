couchdb (0.11.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium (security fixes)

  * New upstream release, including security fix for CVE-2010-00009.

couchdb (0.10.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Elliot Murphy ]
  * Updated debian/control, added Elliot to Uploaders
  * Dropped $ENABLE_SERVER portion of debian/patches/init.patch

  [ Sam Bisbee ]
  * Updated debian/patches/init.patch, adding a grace period to the init
    script's stop task to allow couchdb's child processes (ie., heart) a chance
    to exit before deciding whether the task was successful or not. This adds a
    dependency on procps (`ps` command).
  * Removed debian/preinst, undoing killall preinst patch from 0.10.0-1 that is
    no longer needed due to the grace period init patch in this release. This 
    also removes the dependency on psmisc. (closes: #562901) 
  * Updated debian/control, bumping Debian standards version to 3.8.4.
  * Updated debian/control, adding mawk as a dependency. The majority of
    systems will have it installed with the base system, but it's required and
    not essential. (closes: #569965)

couchdb (0.10.0-1ubuntu2) lucid; urgency=low

    add --no-discard-stderr for 1.37 help2man version (LP: #536740)
  * debian/patches/mozjs_ldlibpath.patch, debian/control: change version of 
    xulrunner to xulrunner-1.9.2 (LP: #536737)

couchdb (0.10.0-1ubuntu1) lucid; urgency=low

  * Merge from Debian testing, remaining changes:
    - split package into couchdb and couchdb-bin binary packages, so that
      the programs can be installed without starting the system service
    - debian/control: add missing erlang-{inets,crypto,xmerl}
      (build-)dependencies
    - debian/control: transition from libmozjs-dev to xulrunner-dev in
      ubuntu
    - debian/rules, debian/control: grab the current xulrunner version with
      "xulrunner --gre-version" to use as a dependency
    - debian/patches/mozjs_ldlibpath.patch: explicitly set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
      pkglibdir of current installed xulrunner version on startup; this works
      around the fact that couchdb relies on the not publicly exported
      libmozjs
    - debian/postinst: change the default permissions on /etc/couchdb to
      0775, and /etc/couchdb/default.ini and /etc/couchdb/local.ini to 0774
    - debian/patches/http-redirect-query-string-fix.patch: fix replication
      over OAuth, which was broken because of incorrect query-string handling
      after HTTP redirection
    - debian/couchdb-bin.postrm: don't try to delete couchdb system
      user/group
    - debian/rules, debian/couchdb.{postinst,postrm}: create
      /var/{log,lib}/couchdb/${couchdbversion}, so couchdb will run.
  * Dropped changes, superseded in Debian:
    - debian/control: bump the Standards-Version to 3.8.2 (latest)
    - debian/copyright: added src/etap/* to copyright file
  * debian/rules: don't munge debian/couchdb-bin.postrm, it doesn't contain
    the VERSION tag anymore
  * Fix permissions on files in /etc/couchdb to be 0664, not 0774 - config
    files should not be executable!
  * Remove the debian/preinst, and drop the build-dependency on psmisc which
    doesn't do the right thing /anyway/.  A preinst invocation implies a
    Pre-Depends, not a Build-Depends, and the heuristic being used here with
    'killall' is useless.
  * Don't recursively chmod /var/lib/couchdb, only chmod the directories -
    we don't want the files to wind up executable.
  * debian/rules: fix dh_installinit invocation to only add scripts for the
    couchdb package, not couchdb-bin.

couchdb (0.10.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Elliot Murphy ]
  * Updated debian/copyright, added src/etap*
  * Updated debian/control, changed Maintainer to Erlang team address
  * Updated debian/control, changed Vcs- links to new locations.

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream release (closes: #551212, #554080, #554593).
  * Removed unnecessary build dependency on transitional erlang-nox package.
  * Replaced subst variables in dependencies by ${erlang:Depends} which allows
    to calculate dependencies automatically. This removes erlang-nox from
    dependencies (closes: #532756).
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.3.
  * It's normal if /etc/init.d script is left after package removal as a
    config file (and the binary isn't available). Therefore made it return
    success in case if /usr/bin/couchdb doesn't exist or isn't an executable.
  * Change current directory to /var/run/couchdb in init script to prevent
    error messages about access violation by code server if the current dir
    isn't readable by the couchdb user.
  * Put log files directly into /var/log/couchdb directory. There's no reason
    to have different log subdirectories for different couchdb versions.

  [ Noah Slater ]
  * Updated debian/control, updated Build-Depends on debhelper to 7.2.11.

  [ Sam Bisbee ]
  * Updated debian/control, repointed Vcs links.
  * Fix "replacing libreadline5-dev build dependency with libreadline-
    dev" Updated debian/control, changed libreadline5-dev dependency to
    libreadline-dev. (Closes: #553742)
  * Updated debian/README.Debian, removed log directory partitioning info
    per Sergei's related changes to put all logs in one directory.
  * Updated debian/postrm, rmdir didn't like that its target directories
    weren't non-empty (despite passed args), causing errors and failing to
    remove directories. Also removed the version partitioning cases.
  * Created debian/preinst, now we make sure that couchdb isn't running any
    beam processes on upgrade. Upgrading from 0.9.0-2 was leaving old code in a
    running beam process, so you were running 0.9.0 couchdb but had 0.10.0 code
    installed until you killed the process. Adds a dependency on psmisc.
